# Abstract

Traditional synthetic‐control estimators recover mean‐level treatment effects by constructing a weighted combination of control units that best reproduces the pre‐treatment trajectory of a treated unit.  **Distributional Synthetic Control** (Gunsilius, 2023) generalizes this idea to the *entire outcome distribution* by replacing squared‐error fit with optimal‐transport discrepancy between empirical distribution functions.  Yet existing implementations assume scalar outcomes such as wages or sales.  We develop a new Latent–Gaussian DiSC (LG‑DiSC) that brings distributional causal analysis to **unstructured text** and other high‐volume digital outputs pervasive in quantitative marketing.  We embed every document in a low‐dimensional latent space using a Variational Auto‑Encoder (VAE), summarize each period’s latent codes by a single multivariate Gaussian, and exploit the closed‐form Wasserstein‑2 distance and barycenter between Gaussian measures.  The approach preserves DiSC’s identification logic, runs in seconds on millions of documents, and, with a decoder, generates counterfactual text for substantive interpretation.  We derive consistency and asymptotic normality of the weight estimator, quantify approximation error from the Gaussian sketch, and validate operating characteristics in simulation.
