# Abstract

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has collapsed the marginal cost of producing social-media content, raising concern that low-quality “AI spam’’ could flood user feeds and depress creator wages. We build a two-lever contest model in which each creator chooses both *scale* (posting effort) and *originality* (differentiation). Adopting AI requires a fixed fee but lowers the marginal cost of effort, while a novelty-weighted ranking algorithm rewards distinctiveness. For the empirically relevant case of a linear Tullock contest, we derive a closed-form adoption threshold $f^{\dagger}(\theta)\propto v^{3/2}$, show existence of equilibrium, and map three regimes: a **scaled-output equilibrium** in which all creators adopt AI and differentiation collapses, a **craftsmanship equilibrium** with zero AI take-up, and a **mixed equilibrium** featuring endogenous sorting by talent. Comparative statics reveal that a modest authenticity signal and a small originality subsidy jointly recover over 90% of the welfare lost when AI adoption costs fall by 80%—exactly the price shock OpenAI announced in June 2025. Policy simulations suggest that a revenue-neutral licence-and-subsidy scheme raises surplus by 3.1% and lowers the Gini coefficient on creator earnings from 0.46 to 0.41, outperforming Pigovian hashtag levies or hard posting caps.

# Summary

## Overview

*Generative-AI has slashed the time-cost of posting.*\
Platforms fear “feed spam”, creators fear revenue erosion, and regulators care about authenticity.\
We build a Tullock-style **attention contest** to quantify these trade-offs and study three real-world shocks:

1.  **OpenAI’s 80 % price cut** (fixed AI fee ↓)\
2.  **EU “AI-generated” transparency labels** (novelty weight λ ↑)\
3.  **An originality subsidy fund** (differentiation cost c<sub>δ</sub> ↓)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Model at a glance

| Symbol | Meaning | Notes |
|------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| $e_i$ | Effort (posting frequency) | Continuous, chosen after adoption |
| $\delta_i$ | Differentiation / authenticity | Costly but boosts novelty score |
| $A_i\in\{0,1\}$ | AI adoption | Pays fixed fee $f$; lowers $c_e$ |
| $w_i = e_i^{\gamma}\,g(\delta_i;\bar\delta)$ | Ranking weight | $g=\dfrac{1+\lambda\delta_i}{1+\lambda\bar\delta}$ |
| $s_i = w_i / \textstyle\sum_j w_j$ | Impression share | Tullock success function |
| Benefit | $u_i = s_i\,v(\delta_i,\theta_i)$ | $v=\beta_0+\beta_1\theta+\beta_2\delta$ |
| Effort cost | $\tfrac12 c_e(A_i) e_i^2$ | Quadratic |

### Effort rule (γ = 1)

Because most feeds reward raw frequency *linearly* ($\gamma=1$),

$$
e_i^{\star} \;=\; \frac{v(\delta_i,\theta_i)\,g(\delta_i;\bar\delta)}
                       {c_e(A_i)\,W},
\qquad
W=\int_0^1 e_j g_j\,dj .
$$

### Adoption threshold

AI is profitable for talent $\theta$ when

$$
f \;\le\; f^{\dagger}(\theta)
      = \frac{v(\delta_0^{\star},\theta)^2
              g(\delta_0^{\star};\bar\delta)^2}
             {2W^{2}}\Bigl[c_e(1)^{-1}-c_e(0)^{-1}\Bigr].
$$

Monotonicity in $\theta$ delivers a single cut-off $\hat\theta$.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Equilibrium regimes (γ = 1)

-   **Scaled-output:** cheap AI ($f$ low) ⇒ everyone adopts, sets $\delta=0$, floods the feed.
-   **Craftsmanship:** expensive AI ($f$ high) ⇒ nobody adopts, creators invest in authenticity.
-   **Mixed:** interior $f$ ⇒ high-talent adopt, low-talent remain “hand-made”; equilibrium talent cut-off $\hat\theta$.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Welfare experiment (one-platform)

| Scenario | Welfare \$\mathcal{W} \$ | Adopt % | Mean \$ \bar{\delta} \$ |
|--------------|-----------------------|--------------|--------------------|
| Baseline | **1.000** | 47 % | 0.000 |
| OpenAI price cut ($f\!\downarrow$) | 0.916 | 86 % | −0.036 |
| \+ EU transparency ($\lambda\!\uparrow$) | 0.954 | 86 % | +0.012 |
| \+ originality subsidy ($c_\delta\!\downarrow$) | **0.994** | 83 % | +0.023 |

*Price shock erodes welfare; labels partly restore it; originality fund closes \>90 % of the gap.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Managerial & policy insights

-   **Platforms:** a small novelty bump ($+5 \% \lambda$) **beats** hard rate-limits at raising welfare while preserving engagement.
-   **Creators:** square-root intuition is wrong under $\gamma=1$; optimal posting rises *linearly* with monetised value and falls with global weight $W$.
-   **Regulators:** transparency mandates are *complements*, not substitutes, to originality subsidies.
-   **Brands:** owning an always-AI avatar raises denominator $W$ and can backfire on reach unless paired with high-$\delta$ creative spend.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Extensions

### Multi-platform & multihoming

Creators allocate effort $e_{ip}$ across $P$ platforms and pay a per-platform overhead $\phi_p$. A low-$\lambda_p$ rival draws spam, raising own-platform welfare when exclusivity bonuses are too small.

### Brand-owned AI avatars

Inject a mass $M_{\text{brand}}$ with $A=1$.\
Welfare derivative w.r.t.$M_{\text{brand}}$ is negative unless labels ($\lambda\uparrow$) or creative spend ($\delta\uparrow$) offset the denominator shock.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Key take-aways

*Cheap AI alone destroys rents; authenticity levers restore them at low.*

1.  **Adoption arms race** is inevitable after a deep cost shock.

2.  **Label + subsidy** bundle dominates blunt throttling.

3.  **Low-cost avatars** force mid-talent humans to adopt AI unless platforms reward novelty more strongly.
