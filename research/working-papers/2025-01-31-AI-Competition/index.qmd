# Abstract

Generative AI slashes the marginal cost of producing social media content, but this same cost shock threatens to push creator economies into low-novelty, rent-dissipating equilibria. We develop a closed-form contest model in which a continuum of creators choose effort, differentiation, and AI adoption while platforms allocate impressions according to a proportional-effort rule weighted by content novelty. When the AI fee falls below an endogenous threshold, the unique equilibrium switches from a mixed regime to a \emph{scaled-output} regime: adoption exceeds 80 percent, average differentiation collapses, and total welfare drops by nearly 10\% in a calibrated exercise matching the recent OpenAI price cut. We show that two lightweight interventions: algorithmic authenticity rewards that raise the novelty weight, and an originality subsidy that lowers the cost of differentiation, can recover the majority of the lost surplus and reduce earnings inequality. Extending the model to competing platforms reveals that higher novelty weights attract exclusive creators, inducing a \emph{bonus arms race} in which cash incentives partially undo welfare gains unless license revenues are recycled into originality grants. The analysis yields tractable welfare conditions that policymakers can evaluate with minimal data and clarifies why disclosure labels improve welfare only when they feed directly into ranking algorithms.

# Summary

## Overview

*Generative-AI has slashed the time-cost of posting.*\
Platforms fear “feed spam”, creators fear revenue erosion, and regulators care about authenticity.\
We build a Tullock-style **attention contest** to quantify these trade-offs and study three real-world shocks:

1.  **OpenAI’s 80 % price cut** (fixed AI fee ↓)\
2.  **EU “AI-generated” transparency labels** (novelty weight λ ↑)\
3.  **An originality subsidy fund** (differentiation cost c<sub>δ</sub> ↓)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Model at a glance

| Symbol | Meaning | Notes |
|------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| $e_i$ | Effort (posting frequency) | Continuous, chosen after adoption |
| $\delta_i$ | Differentiation / authenticity | Costly but boosts novelty score |
| $A_i\in\{0,1\}$ | AI adoption | Pays fixed fee $f$; lowers $c_e$ |
| $w_i = e_i^{\gamma}\,g(\delta_i;\bar\delta)$ | Ranking weight | $g=\dfrac{1+\lambda\delta_i}{1+\lambda\bar\delta}$ |
| $s_i = w_i / \textstyle\sum_j w_j$ | Impression share | Tullock success function |
| Benefit | $u_i = s_i\,v(\delta_i,\theta_i)$ | $v=\beta_0+\beta_1\theta+\beta_2\delta$ |
| Effort cost | $\tfrac12 c_e(A_i) e_i^2$ | Quadratic |

### Effort rule (γ = 1)

Because most feeds reward raw frequency *linearly* ($\gamma=1$),

$$
e_i^{\star} \;=\; \frac{v(\delta_i,\theta_i)\,g(\delta_i;\bar\delta)}
                       {c_e(A_i)\,W},
\qquad
W=\int_0^1 e_j g_j\,dj .
$$

### Adoption threshold

AI is profitable for talent $\theta$ when

$$
f \;\le\; f^{\dagger}(\theta)
      = \frac{v(\delta_0^{\star},\theta)^2
              g(\delta_0^{\star};\bar\delta)^2}
             {2W^{2}}\Bigl[c_e(1)^{-1}-c_e(0)^{-1}\Bigr].
$$

Monotonicity in $\theta$ delivers a single cut-off $\hat\theta$.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Equilibrium regimes (γ = 1)

-   **Scaled-output:** cheap AI ($f$ low) ⇒ everyone adopts, sets $\delta=0$, floods the feed.
-   **Craftsmanship:** expensive AI ($f$ high) ⇒ nobody adopts, creators invest in authenticity.
-   **Mixed:** interior $f$ ⇒ high-talent adopt, low-talent remain “hand-made”; equilibrium talent cut-off $\hat\theta$.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Welfare experiment (one-platform)

| Scenario | Welfare \$\mathcal{W} \$ | Adopt % | Mean \$ \bar{\delta} \$ |
|--------------|-----------------------|--------------|--------------------|
| Baseline | **1.000** | 47 % | 0.000 |
| OpenAI price cut ($f\!\downarrow$) | 0.916 | 86 % | −0.036 |
| \+ EU transparency ($\lambda\!\uparrow$) | 0.954 | 86 % | +0.012 |
| \+ originality subsidy ($c_\delta\!\downarrow$) | **0.994** | 83 % | +0.023 |

*Price shock erodes welfare; labels partly restore it; originality fund closes \>90 % of the gap.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Managerial & policy insights

-   **Platforms:** a small novelty bump ($+5 \% \lambda$) **beats** hard rate-limits at raising welfare while preserving engagement.
-   **Creators:** square-root intuition is wrong under $\gamma=1$; optimal posting rises *linearly* with monetised value and falls with global weight $W$.
-   **Regulators:** transparency mandates are *complements*, not substitutes, to originality subsidies.
-   **Brands:** owning an always-AI avatar raises denominator $W$ and can backfire on reach unless paired with high-$\delta$ creative spend.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Extensions

### Multi-platform & multihoming

Creators allocate effort $e_{ip}$ across $P$ platforms and pay a per-platform overhead $\phi_p$. A low-$\lambda_p$ rival draws spam, raising own-platform welfare when exclusivity bonuses are too small.

### Brand-owned AI avatars

Inject a mass $M_{\text{brand}}$ with $A=1$.\
Welfare derivative w.r.t.$M_{\text{brand}}$ is negative unless labels ($\lambda\uparrow$) or creative spend ($\delta\uparrow$) offset the denominator shock.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Key take-aways

*Cheap AI alone destroys rents; authenticity levers restore them at low.*

1.  **Adoption arms race** is inevitable after a deep cost shock.

2.  **Label + subsidy** bundle dominates blunt throttling.

3.  **Low-cost avatars** force mid-talent humans to adopt AI unless platforms reward novelty more strongly.
