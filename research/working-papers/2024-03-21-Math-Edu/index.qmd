# Abstract

This study investigates the impact of high school mathematics education on the financial behavior of individuals in later life. To assess this relationship, we employ a staggered treatment robust event study design that exploits variations in the requirements of high school math coursework across several US states following a series of curricular reforms in the late 1980s. Our findings indicate that increasing the required level of mathematical education has a significant impact on various aspects of financial behavior in adulthood. Specifically, we observe a reduction of up to 15.4% in monthly spending on packaged goods and a corresponding increase of over 25% in the use of coupons. These effects are robust to potential biases arising from staggered adoption or temporal and spatial correlations. In addition, our analyses demonstrate that the results vary between demographic groups, with a more pronounced effect among minorities. We also observe that the impact of high school math education on financial behavior persists with age, even though the magnitude of the effects may decrease. Further, our study provides evidence of the role of mathematical literacy in shaping consumers' responses to economic crises. Treated households exhibited an increase in the uptake of coupons and price promotions following the Great Recession of 2008. Overall, our study highlights the important role of high school mathematics education in shaping financial behavior in adulthood and sheds light on the potential benefits of enhancing mathematical literacy among the population.

# Summary

## Overview

This paper studies how raising high-school mathematics requirements during the wave of state curricular reforms that followed *A Nation at Risk* (1983) shaped consumers’ long-run saving-related behaviors. Leveraging staggered adoption across states and graduation cohorts, the author links graduates’ math exposure to later household-level scanner data on grocery purchases, documenting sizeable and persistent shifts toward more price-conscious shopping.

## Data & Identification

The core sample contains roughly 680 000 “stayer” households followed by Nielsen from 2004 onward, whose birth and current states can be matched to the timing of reforms. Four monthly outcomes proxy for saving behavior: share of purchases made on sale, coupon utilization rate, private-label share, and log spending. Identification rests on a staggered Difference-in-Differences design, implemented with Sun & Abraham’s (2021) event-study correction and cross-checked by Generalized Synthetic Control and doubly robust estimators.

## Key Findings

Accounting for staggered timing more than doubles the estimated effect of reform on the purchase-on-sale share, from 1.21 pp to 2.54 pp. Coupon use rises by about 0.7 pp—roughly a 26% increase over baseline usage . Most strikingly, monthly packaged-goods expenditure falls by 15.4 %, or about \$62 on a \$400 base. Household-level specifications confirm positive but slightly attenuated effects once finer fixed effects absorb additional variation.

## Heterogeneity & Dynamics

Reform effects amplify during adverse macro shocks: after the 2008 Great Recession, treated households intensified couponing and bargain hunting, while the spending reduction became less pronounced. Treatment impacts are largest for minority (Asian and Black) households on coupon use and private-label share, and peak for middle-income families (\$60–100k), with unexpected attenuation at the very bottom of the income.

## Robustness

Placebo shifts in treatment timing, models with state-specific trends, Generalized Synthetic Control, and Callaway-Sant’Anna doubly robust estimators all yield qualitatively similar patterns, alleviating concerns over differential trends or spatial correlation.

## Managerial & Policy Implications

Findings imply that strengthening quantitative curricula not only benefits labor-market outcomes but also cultivates consumers who plan ahead, exploit discounts, and exhibit greater financial resilience during downturns. Retailers may anticipate higher coupon redemption and promotion sensitivity in markets with stronger math education, while policymakers gain additional evidence that math literacy promotes household welfare through everyday economic decisions.
