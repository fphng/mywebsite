I grew up in the beautiful town of [Hoi An](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%E1%BB%99i_An), an ancient trading port in central Vietnam.

I spent my high school years in nearby Da Nang City, attending Le Qui Don High School for the Gifted, where I specialized in Chemistry, and stumbled my way into getting an National Olympiad in Informatics Gold medal.

For college, I went to Foreign Trade University in Ho Chi Minh City, where I studied Economics and International Business.

Afterwards, I spent two years in the Fintech sector, where I spearheaded the development of one of the earliest banking chatbots in Southeast Asia, which allowed customers to apply and manage their loans and credit cards with ease via Facebook Messenger, Whatsapp, and other messaging platforms, using natural language.

I moved to the US in 2017 to pursue my MBA/MS.in Marketing Analytics at the AC Nielsen Center for Marketing Research at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and then down south to Atlanta for my Ph.D. in Quantitative Marketing at Emory University.
