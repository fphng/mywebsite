    "text": "Abstract\nThis study investigates the impact of high school mathematics education on the financial behavior of individuals in later life. To assess this relationship, we employ a staggered treatment robust event study design that exploits variations in the requirements of high school math coursework across several US states following a series of curricular reforms in the late 1980s. Our findings indicate that increasing the required level of mathematical education has a significant impact on various aspects of financial behavior in adulthood. Specifically, we observe a reduction of up to 15.4% in monthly spending on packaged goods and a corresponding increase of over 25% in the use of coupons. These effects are robust to potential biases arising from staggered adoption or temporal and spatial correlations. In addition, our analyses demonstrate that the results vary between demographic groups, with a more pronounced effect among minorities. We also observe that the impact of high school math education on financial behavior persists with age, even though the magnitude of the effects may decrease. Further, our study provides evidence of the role of mathematical literacy in shaping consumers‚Äô responses to economic crises. Treated households exhibited an increase in the uptake of coupons and price promotions following the Great Recession of 2008. Overall, our study highlights the important role of high school mathematics education in shaping financial behavior in adulthood and sheds light on the potential benefits of enhancing mathematical literacy among the population."

    "text": "There‚Äôs tons of resources out there for how to built a personal website as an academic, made by folks with actual expertise in web design, coding, etc.\nI‚Äôd wanted to start my own blog / digital garden for years. Initially, the roadblock was imposter syndrome - did I actually have anything to write about? Would it be useful to anyone? isn‚Äôt it all a bit cringe?1\nOnce those worries were shouted down overcome, the main roadblock became technical know-how. I originally developed my website using a bundle of tools including blogdown, github, netlify all centered around the very popular academic theme from hugo. I‚Äôve had it for years now, but it was heavy-lifting - building it took what felt like a week of work back in 2020, and I couldn‚Äôt update easily without having to relearn the folder structure rules each time.\nOriginally, I wanted to tweak the theme, add some blog pages and be done with it, but writeups like this from Maelle Salmon discussing hugo theme maintenance and this one from Alison Hill on Quarto made me wonder if there was a better way.\nThe straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back was vanity the Tufte theme that‚Äôs possible in Quarto - per the requirements of receiving a degree in geography, my copy of Visual Display of Quantitative Information lives on my coffee table. Adding Tufte‚Äôs beautiful sidenotes and column spacing is as easy as adding a line or two of yaml in Quarto and opens up a whole new world of snarky asides2."

Working from Rstudio, you simply open a New Project, select Quarto Website, name it something new and click Render to preview.\nYour Rstudio will look like this:\n\n\n\na brand new quarto website\n\n\nAnd your render will look like this:\n\n\n\noff to the races\n\n\nThat‚Äôs it. 4 steps, and you‚Äôre previewing a website with a landing page, a menu bar and two pages. Now, your render won‚Äôt be hosted anywhere but locally, but already that‚Äôs a much more easy entry than the one I remember from Hugo.\n\n\nTo add a blog:\nTo add a blog6, or any pages that will live under a different landing page than the home page, add the following steps:\n6¬†You can also create a ‚ÄúQuarto Blog‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúQuarto Website‚Äù by going to New Project - I just wanted to figure out how to do it by hand so I knew how to initiate other website pages down the line\nCreate a landing page\n\nInitiate a quarto file for your landing page and call it something like blog.qmd\nWithin blog.qmd, add the following lines to the yaml code at the top:\n\nlisting:\n  contents: posts\n  sort: \"date desc\"\n  type: default\n  categories: true\n  sort-ui: false\n  filter-ui: false\nNow, you‚Äôll need to add it to your site navigation:\n\nNavigate to your _quarto.yml file which should have been created when you initiated the New Website process above\nYou should see yml code - mine looks like the following:\n\nproject:\n  type: website\n\nwebsite:\n  title: \"Katherine Hayes\"\n  navbar:\n    right:\n      - text: \"About Me\"\n        file: about.qmd\n    \nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: cosmo\n    css: styles.css\n    toc: false\n\neditor: visual\n\nUnder navbar, add lines that specify text and file similar to the example above (so, probably text: ‚ÄúBlog‚Äù and file: blog.qmd)\nCreate a folder called posts - your posts will live here, within individual folders\nWithin posts, each folder will contain an index.qmd file for the blog post\n\n\n\nWriting a blog post\n\n\nHow to make a Series\nTo publish blog posts in a series, they need to be located in a subdirectory of the posts folder. You‚Äôll also need a landing page. I‚Äôm writing up a series of posts on some of the model parameterization work I‚Äôve done recently for my fire-herbivory project, so I named my series folder posts/param_series and added a landing page named param_landing.gmd (I know, creative). Make sure the landing page is located in the top directory, the one where your about / index / blog quarto documents are located.\nWithin the landing page,\ntitle: \"Series: ggplot2-tips\"\nlisting:\n  contents: posts/ggplot2-tips\n  sort: \"date desc\"\n  type: default\n  categories: false\n  sort-ui: false\n  filter-ui: false\n  fields: [date, title, reading-time, description]\npage-layout: full\ntitle-block-banner: true\nYou‚Äôll need to modify the contents: setting within your blog.qmd file so it sees the contents of the series folder. You can do this using glob syntax - a very fun name for what essentially means ‚Äúglobal patterns‚Äù. ** can be used to tell quarto to look within any folder, and *.qmd will select any quarto document.\nThus, you can then change your blog yml from:\ntitle: \"Blog\"\nsubtitle: \"An attempt at a digital garden / notebook\"\nlisting:\n  contents: posts\nTo this:\ntitle: \"Blog\"\nsubtitle: \"An attempt at a digital garden / notebook\"\nlisting:\n  contents: \n  - posts/**/*.qmd\n  - posts/**/**/*.qmd\nAnd it should catch any quarto documents within the nested folders."

    "text": "Abstract\nTraditional synthetic‚Äêcontrol estimators recover mean‚Äêlevel treatment effects by constructing a weighted combination of control units that best reproduces the pre‚Äêtreatment trajectory of a treated unit. Distributional Synthetic Control (Gunsilius, 2023) generalizes this idea to the entire outcome distribution by replacing squared‚Äêerror fit with optimal‚Äêtransport discrepancy between empirical distribution functions. Yet existing implementations assume scalar outcomes such as wages or sales. We develop a new Latent‚ÄìGaussian DiSC (LG‚ÄëDiSC) that brings distributional causal analysis to unstructured text and other high‚Äêvolume digital outputs pervasive in quantitative marketing. We embed every document in a low‚Äêdimensional latent space using a Variational Auto‚ÄëEncoder (VAE), summarize each period‚Äôs latent codes by a single multivariate Gaussian, and exploit the closed‚Äêform Wasserstein‚Äë2 distance and barycenter between Gaussian measures. The approach preserves DiSC‚Äôs identification logic, runs in seconds on millions of documents, and, with a decoder, generates counterfactual text for substantive interpretation. We derive consistency and asymptotic normality of the weight estimator, quantify approximation error from the Gaussian sketch, and validate operating characteristics in simulation."

    "text": "Abstract\nGenerative artificial intelligence (AI) has collapsed the marginal cost of producing social-media content, raising concern that low-quality ‚ÄúAI spam‚Äô‚Äô could flood user feeds and depress creator wages. We build a two-lever contest model in which each creator chooses both scale (posting effort) and originality (differentiation). Adopting AI requires a fixed fee but lowers the marginal cost of effort, while a novelty-weighted ranking algorithm rewards distinctiveness. For the empirically relevant case of a linear Tullock contest, we derive a closed-form adoption threshold \\(f^{\\dagger}(\\theta)\\propto v^{3/2}\\), show existence of equilibrium, and map three regimes: a scaled-output equilibrium in which all creators adopt AI and differentiation collapses, a craftsmanship equilibrium with zero AI take-up, and a mixed equilibrium featuring endogenous sorting by talent. Comparative statics reveal that a modest authenticity signal and a small originality subsidy jointly recover over 90% of the welfare lost when AI adoption costs fall by 80%‚Äîexactly the price shock OpenAI announced in June 2025. Policy simulations suggest that a revenue-neutral licence-and-subsidy scheme raises surplus by 3.1% and lowers the Gini coefficient on creator earnings from 0.46 to 0.41, outperforming Pigovian hashtag levies or hard posting caps."
